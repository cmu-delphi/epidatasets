\item \href{https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast-signals/jhu-csse.html}{From the COVIDcast Epidata API}:
These signals are taken directly from the JHU CSSE
\href{https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19}{COVID-19 GitHub repository}
without changes. The 7-day average signals are computed by Delphi by
calculating moving averages of the preceding 7 days, so the signal for
June 7 is the average of the underlying data for June 1 through 7,
inclusive.

\description{
This data source of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths is based on reports
made available by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns
Hopkins University, as downloaded from the CMU Delphi COVIDcast Epidata
API. This example data ranges from Dec 31, 2020 to Dec 31, 2021, and
includes all states. It is used in the {epiprocess} correlation vignette.
