\itemize{
\item \href{https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast-signals/jhu-csse.html}{From the COVIDcast Epidata API}:  The signal \code{confirmed_cumulative_num} was used to determine eligibility for inclusion. The signal \code{confirmed_7dav_incidence_prop} was computed by Delphi from the original JHU-CSSE data by calculating moving averages of the preceding 7 days, so the signal for June 7 is the average of the underlying data for June 1 through 7, inclusive.
\item Furthermore, the data has been limited to a specific time range, the
signal names slightly altered, and formatted into an \code{epi_df}.

\description{
Data set for more than 400 US counties containing CLI
(COVID-19-like-illness) incidence derived from two surveys, and a reference signal as
reported by JHU CSSE. This example data is a snapshot as of September 21,
2020, and ranges from April 11, 2020 to September 01, 2020.

The reference signal \code{case} is based on reports made available
by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins
University.

One survey was
\href{https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast-signals/google-survey.html}{run by Google},
in partnership with Delphi.

The other survey, the
\href{https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast-signals/fb-survey.html}{COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey},
was run by Delphi in collaboration with Facebook.

Data is reported for counties that had at least 200 cumulative COVID-19 cases
on May 14, 2020, according to JHU CSSE.
