#' * \href{https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast-signals/jhu-csse.html}{From the COVIDcast Epidata API}:
#'   These signals are taken directly from the JHU CSSE
#'   \href{https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19}{COVID-19 GitHub repository}
#'   without changes. The 7-day average signals are computed by Delphi by
#'   calculating moving averages of the preceding 7 days, so the signal for
#'   June 7 is the average of the underlying data for June 1 through 7,
#'   inclusive.
